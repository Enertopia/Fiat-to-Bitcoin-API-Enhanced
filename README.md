# Fiat-to-Bitcoin-API-Enhanced
An enhanced version of the Fiat-to-Bitcoin conversion API, incorporating improvements and best practices.

Real-life Application

Imagine a financial application where users can convert their fiat currency to Bitcoin directly from their bank account. Upon receiving a conversion request from the user through a web interface or mobile app, the app backend sends a POST request to this Flask service with the fiat amount and conversion percentage. The service processes the request, updates the user's bank and wallet balances, and returns a summary of the transaction. This setup could be part of a larger application ecosystem, offering users a seamless experience for managing their cryptocurrency investments.
Running the Service

    The script listens on port 5000 and is configured to run in a secure context (ssl_context='adhoc'), which generates a temporary self-signed SSL certificate. This is suitable for development but should be replaced with a valid SSL certificate for production use.
